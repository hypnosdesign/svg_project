#Instructions
In this project, you'll be given a website with rasterized images (PNG files) along with matching SVG files. You'll need to replace the rasterized images and modernize the UI using the SVGs.


----------


**NOTE:** To get an "Exceeds Expectations" grade for this project, you'll need to "exceed" on every requirement that has an "Exceeds Expectations" option.


----------


**NOTE:** The Front End Web Development Techdegree is meant to train you in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and let you practice and show your mastery of these fundamental building blocks of the web. Because of that, please avoid using frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, Skeleton, and so on for this project. Even though you may end up using frameworks like these professionally, you still need to know and be able to implement designs with your own knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

In addition, please avoid submitting any projects that rely on a server-side technology like PHP or Ruby on Rails.

##Project Instructions

To complete this project, follow the instructions below. If you get stuck, ask a question in the community.



**10 Steps**
--------
**1** [x]
Replace the background pattern PNG with the matching SVG (background.svg). Use CSS to resize the SVG to match the original design.

----------

**2** [x]
Replace rasterized PNG logo with the SVG logo image (logo.svg): use the inline SVG method to add it (you'll use CSS to modify the image).
________________________

**3** [x]
At a page width of less than 420 pixels remove the text from the logo and add an H1 tag that contains the logo text.
________
**4** [x]
Replace dogs with SVG images using the <img> tag.
_____________
**5** [x]
Change icons in the menu from rasterized images to inline SVGs.
_______
**6**
When a user hovers over the menu icons, use CSS to change their color to match the text color.
________
**7**
You will need to check your website in at least 3 different browsers to ensure the SVG images you have added load correctly and look the same across different browsers.

+ You can use Chrome and Firefox, if you have a PC also check your site using Internet Explorer and if you have a Mac check it using Safari.

______
**8**
When submitting your project be sure to make a note in the comments which browsers and versions you have tested with.
______
**9**
And remember you can only use an 'ID' once so double check the SVG images when adding them.
______
**10**
Make sure to check your code is valid by running it through an HTML and CSS validator.

+ Links to the validators can be found in the Project Resources. This will help you spot any errors that might be in your code.

+ There are a few exceptions that you don’t need to fix:
Don’t worry about any warnings, we just need you to check any errors that might be there.
	+ If CSS validator flags use of calc, or vendor prefixes these errors should be ignored.
	+ If HTML validator flags use of pipe (‘|’) in Google font links/URLs this error can also be ignored.
	+ The CSS Validator does not recognize the SVG attributes like fill as valid attributes. Take a look at the SVG Attribute Reference for SVG attributes that are acceptable even if they do not pass the validator.

##Extra Credit

To get an "exceeds" rating, you can expand on the project in the following ways:

**2 Steps**
------

**1**
Use inline SVGs for the images of the dogs and then change the color of the dogs' coats using CSS to match the original colors of the dogs. (You can find the colors used by looking at the CSS within the SVG dog files)
_______
**2**
Add additional CSS effects, like transition effects to the menu icon hover state.
